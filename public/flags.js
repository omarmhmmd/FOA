Flags Of Afghanistan بيرق هاى افغانستان places these flags in political, cultural, and design contexts; building visual and historical relationships that aim to archive the past while informing the future.\n\nIn 1880, Abdul Rahman Khan converted Afghanistan from a land of empires and tribes to an emirate. The history of 20th century Afghanistan begins with a black flag; a blank slate.\n\nIt was during Khan’s reign that Afghanistan’s modern day borders were drawn. Khan oversaw the establishment of the Durand Line in 1893, the border between what was then British India and Afghanistan.\n\nAbdul Rahman Khan died of a natural death in 1901, and was succeeded by his son Habibullah Khan",

    description:"Amanullah Khan was extremely interested in introducing western ideals to the country, affecting the government, society, and culture. His wife, Soraya Tarzi, daughter of Afghan intellectual and proponent of a modern Afghan state Mahmud Tarzi, was the first Queen to advocate for women’s rights and become a symbol of liberalism within the government.\n\nMahmud Tarzi had been raised in Turkey (Ottoman Empire) as the Tarzi family had been placed in exile by Abdul Rahman Khan, Amanullah’s grandfather. Amanullah’s father, Habibullah, allowed them to return during his reign. This time in Turkey and in the west helped him develop modernist ideas on politics, government, and journalism coupled with Islam, which his now son-in-law was strongly promoting throughout his reign.\n\nThe first flag of Amanullah’s rule consists of (one of many future) redesigns of the masjid, minbar and mihrab, and sheathed sword illustrations. The masjid now features a recognizable dome, minbar, mihrab, and even a tiled floor. The swords look a little more like scissors, and there is a shape at the top of the dome that oddly resembles an apple with a hole in it; this is perhaps a pomegranate, a revered fruit grown throughout the country. However as with many of the design decisions in each of these flags, not enough is known to be certain.\n\nThe most significant aspect of this flag is the replacement of a wreath with an octagram masked in linear rays. This could be used to depict a sun, representing a new era or a fresh start, which could also be referencing the similar types of emblems used by the Ottoman Empire through its own flag history. It is hard to say otherwise, but thinking about both Amanullah and Mahmud’s background and interest in western European ideals, the octagram could be referencing to a change in Afghanistan akin to the change Mustafa Kemal Atatürk brought to the new Republic of Turkey: secularization, western attire, modernization, etc.\n\nIt was also in 1919 that Amanullah declared independence from the British. While celebrating independence from a western force, the country was forced to build anew, and forced to take cues from the west as it grew."

    description: "In 1928, the Afghan flag takes on the long-lasting horizontal bands of black, red, and green. During this time Amanullah Khan had traveled to Europe and visited with many head-of-states there. There is speculation that this version of the flag was inspired by the German flag of the time; a three horizontal band with black, red, and gold, the previous symbol of pre-Nazi Germany.\n\nThe insignia returns temporarily to the octagram rays, with a two-dimensional masjid at center. Whereas the black color of the previous flags had no true meaning, in this case the colors are symbolic. Some argue the black represents the past as a whole, and a nod to the old flags. The red for bloodshed, battles, and wars of the past. The green, a representation of Islam and a sign of good fortune. These colors also make reference to the Pan-Arab colors of black, white, green, and red seen on many Arab/Islamic country flags. This color palette becomes one of the most extreme symbols of identity and culture for Afghanistan as the years go on.",

Almost 50 years after the start  of the Khan dynasty rule, this flag introduces a completely  new symbolism and design language to the design system of the Afghan flag.\n\nThe bands take on a vertical orientation for the first time, keeping the previous colors and order intact. The centered mosque is replaced with snow-cap mountains, a rising sun behind them, topped with a yellow star. This is a rare moment in Afghan visual cultural history where the geography of its mountains are used as a visual and cultural element in depicting Afghan identity.\n\nHere the sun could be used as a symbol referencing an ancient region that modern Afghanistan encompasses: Khorasan, roughly translated to “rising sun”, a name that is at times used interchangeably to describe the land that Afghanistan sits upon.\n\nWrapped around this image is a wreath of wheat, tied by a band that has on it the first piece of writing seen on a flag: الله and محممد. While the flag loses the religious symbolism of the mosque, it gains the written names of God and His final messenger.\n\nPerhaps Amanullah had grand visions for a new version of his country that dove into its past and current self to create new cultural meaning and values, and in the process created a flag that was a literal reflection of the land it waved on. Mountains, countrysides, and rising suns."

Facing defeat, Amanullah fled the country, handing the country over to his brother, Inayatullah. Inayatullah, after three days, handed over the country to Kalakani, surrendering and living in exile.\n\nKalakani designated Afghanistan an emirate once more, ordering religious and social reforms. The flag of Kalakani’s rule continued with a vertical orientation, but took on a completely new color pattern: red, black, and white. The complete departure from black, red, and green marked a departure from the previous Pashtun majority rule of Afghanistan.\n\nAfterall, Kalakani is one of only two leaders of Tajik descent to have sat on the throne. His rule was not only at odds with Amanullah’s modernist ideals, but with the rule of Pashtun’s over the Afghan region for so many years.\n\nAfter only 9 months of rule, Kalakani was captured and executed by forces loyal to the previous throne."

    description: "One year into his rule, Nadir Shah introduced a new updated emblem. This masjid structure was last seen in 1926, yet its flags contain small vertical strokes, representing the vertical tricolor bands. Right below it we see the first numbers on an Afghan flag: the year the flag was instated, 1348, based on the Solar Hijri calendar. The wreath has received an updated illustration of wheat, and on its ribbon Afghanistan is written in Farsi. This is the first moment the name of the country is embedded on its flag.\n\nAfter four years of rule and conservative efforts of modernization across the country, Nadir Shah was assassinated by a high school student. Although progress was made towards building an Afghanistan for the future, and some would say Afghanistan was in a “good” state, there were still those that opposed the Shah and the royal family throughout their reign.\n\nZahir Shah, son of Nadir, succeeded his father after his assassination. At 19 years old power was shared between the young king and his advisors,  mostly  family members.\n\nZahir kept his father’s original flag; the lifespan of this flag remains the longest in Afghan history. This also makes Zahir Shah Afghanistan’s final and longest serving king. For almost 43 years, Afghanistan built an identity based on this flag with a vertical tricolor pattern, wheated wreath, and centered masjid with Afghanistan written at its base. The current global “image” of the Afghan flag is based upon this model: google searches, emojis, pop-culture, fashion, and so much more utilize this flag. Although at the time of writing the Taliban are in control waving their own flag, some Afghans around the world still identify with this version of the flag.\n\nZahir Shah’s rule continued an emphasis on modernization, social, political, and economic reform, and an effort to maintain a peaceful and united Afghanistan. As Afghanistan was making progress taking global space in the 20th century, new world powers Russia and USA both took interest in the country. Staying neutral during WWII, Afghanistan was the only country to continue diplomatic and financial relationships with both America and Russia during the Cold War.\n\nBased on his 40 years of rule without major opposition to the throne, it would seem that these 40 years were a progressive and successful era for Afghanistan and its people. However, Zahir Shah didn’t make as much progress as some would have hoped, including his own cousin. Mohammed Daoud Khan led a bloodless coup against his cousin when Zahir Shah was traveling in Europe, seizing power and establishing an autocratic one-party republic, proclaiming himself the first President of Afghanistan."

During this transitory period, he kept the flag of Zahir’s reign but removed the year 1348; the year Nadir Shah took the throne."

The emblem, now much smaller, is no longer center but top-left aligned; a canton (emblem placed at the top-left of a flag).\n\nPresented in a gold and brown palette, the new emblem depicts an eagle encircled by a wheat wreath, topped with an abstract visualization of a rising sun. The bottom of the wreath reads the date and Afghanistan in Farsi. Within the center of the eagle is a combined minbar/mihrab embedded into one another. This abstract motif is later used in flags whose governments adhered to communism.\n\nDaoud leaned harder towards alliances with the west as his presidency continued, leaning less and less on the Soviet Union for support. By 1978, The People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA), a socialist political party founded in 1965, grew upset with the lack of progress Daoud Khan had made for the country, with the weak relationship he maintained with the Soviet Union, and with the way he treated the PDPA and its members. In April of 1978, the PDPA led a bloody coup against Daoud Khan at the Arg (Royal Palace), known as the Saur Revolution (Saur ثور being the Solar Hijri month at the time). Daoud and members of his family were executed, some 2,000 of his followers and supporters were killed, and those with previous royal ties were forced to leave the country. This event begins the true unrest that Afghanistan will continue to see for many years to come."

Placed on a plain red background, the Khalq emblem itself takes space as the canton/top-left section. Resembling from afar the hammer and sickle of the Soviet flag, the Khalq emblem contains the wheat wreath seen in past flags, topped with a Soviet-style star, and a banner that reads “Saur Revolution 1358.” Centered in the emblem is Khalq, written in the nastaliq script style. This is the largest typographic moment in Afghan flag history so far; خلق is written in such a way and size that it almost exists as a logo or major graphic element.\n\nThe entire visual relationship that Afghans built with the tricolor black, red, and green over 40 years was eliminated overnight. Red overtook the flags, government buildings, and daily Afghan life. However, after a short period of rule Taraki’s trust and reliance on other government members, Afghan socio-cultural values, and his closest cabinet members began to deteriorate, while his trust and reliance on the Soviet Union, communist ideals, and secular values grew."

After a failed assassination attempt against Amin, Amin ordered the army to take control of the government and take Taraki as captive, without consulting his Soviet allies. Taraki was then killed.\n\nIn turn, Amin’s relationship with the Soviet Union deteriorated due to his uncalculated actions and wrongful claim of power. It was at this point the Soviet Union felt they had to physically intervene with force, or else all the efforts and work they put into the control of Afghanistan would fall apart or even backfire. The Soviets invaded Afghanistan, killed Hafizullah Amin, and placed the leader of the Parcham faction, Babrak Karmal, in the seat of power.\n\nIn his “inauguration” speech, Karmal made it clear that the evil rule of the Khalqs was over, and a return to a familiar, peaceful Afghanistan would occur. The flag reverted to the traditional Afghan black, red, and green colors. A canton emblem still in place, it exists as a “redesign/mash-up” of many past emblem elements.\n\nA wheat wreath, rising sun, and star are present; however the star is prominent and red. Half of a cog finishes the top, while a book is set in the bottom; the Quran or the communist manifesto? The same combined minbar/mihrab seen in Daoud Khan’s emblem from 1974 is centered in the emblem. With this icon, and all other elements, Karmal and the Parchams present a flag that considers the old Afghanistan: land of the rising sun, agricultural society, and an islamic nation, while also considering the new Afghanistan: Soviet influence, communism, and industry."

Reviews and ratings by the people on Karmal’s performance and leadership were extremely low. It was at this point multiple resistance forces combined to form the Mujahideen and took arms against the Soviet Occupation. The Soviet Union believed Karmal could not get the job done, and after much persuasion, forced Karmal to resign from power.\n\nAfter Karmal’s fall, the Soviet Union had another puppet in mind, Mohammad Najibullah, the leader of KHAD (Khadamat-e Aetla'at-e Dawlati) Afghanistan’s intelligence agency under Soviet reign. Najibullah’s flag took moderate design changes: most elements were placed in a different fashion: the cog, the minbar/mihrab, and the rising sun. However the star and book were omitted.\n\nSoon the Mujahideen uprising against the Soviet invasion was in full effect, with different regions, religious, and ethnic groups creating their own factions, working together to rid of the communist threat that was the Soviet Union. Although placed in power by the Soviet Union, the withdrawal of Soviet troops after a failed occupation, the eventual dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, and the success of the Mujahideen left Najibullah powerless.\n\nThe Mujahideen eventually took over Kabul, and Najibullah was forced to take asylum in the United Nations headquarters until the Taliban took over Kabul in 1996 and killed him."

He worked to get all resistance voices heard towards forming a unified government. The transitional flag at this time is the first of its kind in Afghan history. The horizontal orientation is back, yet the traditional red band is omitted. In its place is white, and the words “Allahu Akbar” and “La ilaha illa-ilah Muhammadan rasul ullah”, “God is Great” and the Shahada: “There is no God but God, and Mohammad is his Messenger”, are written across the top two bands.\n\nThis is the first instance where the script appears to be hand written, perhaps scanned and vectorized in some sort of software, and then digitally printed and placed on the flag; these are all guesses. The reason this looks to be the case is because Islamic calligraphy, handwritten or not, never lacks precise and calculated curves and forms. Due to the lack of hi-resolution graphic methodologies at the time in the 90’s, it appears to be that the translation from hand drawn to digital production was carried out rather poorly, albeit creating a unique aesthetic all on its own."

The flag donned the Shahada at full width scale. The only other country that enlists the Shahada on their flag is Saudi Arabia, but not at this scale and and the entirety of its flag.\n\nThe Shahada on the Taliban and Saudi flag are both extremely similar; they are written in a classic calligraphic script that can be found in many instances where the Shahada is rendered. A simple google image search of “Shahada” will place it in context.\n\nAs was the case with the transitional flag of Mojaddedi’s rule a couple years before, the script has been modified and vectorized in such a way that it loses most of its fine precise curvature and details. This could have occurred by way of a simple image-to-logo conversion that software like Photoshop and Illustrator are capable of achieving: supply the software with an image, and the components are then vectorized for production purposes. It gets the job done, but at a high cost of detail to the image and output. This can be done if there is a need to scale an image to a bigger size, or to print on a certain material; in this case the assumption was to enlarge the script of the Shahada big enough to place on the new flag."

The year 1348, when Nadir Shah reclaimed Afghanistan from Habibbulah Kalakani is replaced with 1298, the year Amanullah Khan declared independence from the British. This visual cue acts as a renewed symbol of Afghanistan’s independence from all outside forces as a whole, which ultimately would never be the case.\n\nThis flag witnessed the first peaceful transition of democratic power in Afghanistan’s history. In 2014 Ashraf Ghani is elected president, and Karzai steps down and transfers the republic to its new leader; this time the flag did not change. Afghanistan continued to see an ever-growing presence of peace and prosperity, culturally, financially, and politically. However, always a challenge but at this point never a threat, the Taliban’s influence and power began to rebuild as its relations with the US also began to grow."

    description: "By August 15th, 2021, the Taliban fought their way across Afghanistan to Kabul, and walked right in. Ashraf Ghani escaped the royal palace in a helicopter, and in the blink of an eye, Afghanistan now belonged to the Taliban all over again. Donald Trump’s presidency built a working relationship with the Taliban, recognizing them as a legitimate group, striking deals and agreements without consulting the actual government of Afghanistan. As the Taliban slowly but surely took control of Afghanistan, Joe Biden’s heinous act of withdrawal from Afghanistan did nothing to stop them.\n\nIt is April 04, 2022 at the time of writing this, and the Taliban are in complete control of Afghanistan under the Islamic Emirate. They have treated the tricolor flag as a sign of resistance, and fly the same white Shahada flag from 1996. The only change is that the Arabic script in this flag seems to be rendered correctly this time, the miscalculated vectorization and lack of high quality graphic design being a thing of the past. However, even though their flag has been updated, it is still not certain how successfully the updated version of the Taliban and the Islamic Emirate will govern this new chapter of Afghanistan."
